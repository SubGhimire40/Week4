Key Program Features (Workshop Week 4)

passFail.java: Determines if a numerical score meets a passing threshold using a simple if-else block.

oddEven.java: Checks whether an integer input is an odd or even number using the modulo operator (%) and an if-else condition.

PositiveNegativeZero.java: Identifies if a number is positive, negative, or zero using standard if-else if-else logic.

DivisibleBy5and8.java: Determines if an integer input is simultaneously divisible by both 5 and 8, demonstrating compound conditional operators (&&).

UnSortedNested.java: Demonstrates the use of deeply nested if statements to handle multiple, sequential logical decisions.

DiscountSwitch.java: Calculates the final discounted price using a clean switch statement based on a category code (A, B, C, D) and validates the category input.

FloatGpaConverter.java: Converts a numeric GPA (0.0 to 4.0) into its corresponding letter grade (e.g., A+, B) using if-else if logic, with strict validation for the GPA range.

ScholarshipChecker.java: Evaluates student eligibility based on three criteria (GPA, Attendance, and Attitude Score) using a consolidated compound conditional statement (if with &&).

PaperSize.java: Provides the standard millimeter and inch dimensions for ISO A-series paper sizes (A0 to A5). Uses a switch statement for direct lookup and validates input strings precisely.

NepalTaxDoubleDoc.java: Calculates progressive income tax across six brackets using a robust if-else if ladder and ensures all financial inputs are positive via a do-while validation loop.

CinemaTicketMonolith.java: Determines the final ticket price by applying base rates (using switch), language surcharges, and applying sequential student and festival discounts based on user confirmation.
